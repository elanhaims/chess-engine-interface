# Computer Vision Assisted Chess Engine Interface for Chess.Com

## Introduction

This project uses python and opencv template matching to convert screenshots of a chess 
board into a FEN string. Then, the FEN string is passed into a chess engine which returns
the optimal move to play in the position.

## Disclaimer

Using a chess engine is against the Chess.com terms of service. I created this project
for learning purposes and not as a means to cheat in online rated chess matches. 
I have been given permission by the Chess.com staff to build and test this project. 
If you wish to test this project, you must do so in an unrated game against a 
user on your friends list. You must also get their written permission to use a
chess engine against them in the Chess.com game chat before the game begins. 
Failure to follow these rules can result in the termination of your Chess.com account.
